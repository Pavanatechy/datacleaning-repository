 1.loaded the Titanic dataset for analysis.
2. Dropped irrelevant columns such as 'Name', 'Ticket', and 'Cabin' to reduce complexity.
3. Handled missing data by imputing numerical columns with their mean values and categorical columns with their mode.
4. Converted categorical features like 'Sex' and 'Fare' into numerical values using label encoding and one-hot encoding respectively.
5. Scaled numeric features such as 'Age' and 'SibSp' using standardization for better model performance.
6. Ended up with a clean, numerical, and complete dataset ready for machine learning modeling
